# Real Docker Compose, exercising the one thing the installer suite cannot.
#
# tests/installer.sh runs against a fake `docker` that echoes what it is asked
# and agrees with everything. That is the right trade for testing rollback and
# ordering, but it means no test ever observed how Compose actually resolves a
# file — and a first-install bug lived behind that blind spot: compose.yaml
# declares `env_file: .env`, Compose resolves it against --project-directory
# rather than against the compose file, and the installer pointed that at an
# install root which has no .env until validation has already passed.
#
# So this asks the real thing, with the real compose.yaml, against a genuinely
# empty install directory — the exact shape of a keeper's first install.
